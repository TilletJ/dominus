Dominus Project
===============

This is the folder where we have worked. All the versions asked have been done, and can be find easily with the tags, or by following this links :

- [x] [Version 1.0](https://github.com/TilletJ/dominus/tree/Version_1.0) : A script that does a dummy action when actioning the virtual switch in Domoticz.
- [x] [Version 2.0](https://github.com/TilletJ/dominus/tree/Version_2.0) : The script switches on and off a LED plugged in the **GPIO 17** of the RPI3.
- [x] [Version 3.0](https://github.com/TilletJ/dominus/tree/Version_3.0) : A relay has been added in the electric installation.
- [x] [Version 4.0](https://github.com/TilletJ/dominus/tree/Version_4.0) : A client-server has been implemented. The client sends a message to the server that switches the LED state.
- [x] [Version 5.0](https://github.com/TilletJ/dominus/tree/Version_5.0) : A daemon has been created to launch the server when the RPI boots.
- [x] [Version 6.0](https://github.com/TilletJ/dominus/tree/Version_6.0) : The final version of the project has been tested successfully on 2 RPI : one is the server actually connected to the LED (via the relay), and the other is the client with Domoticz.
